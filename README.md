🔹 1. Install & Set Up Streamlit

* First, I installed Streamlit to create a web-based tool.
* I created a new Python file for my project.

📊 2. Load & Display Data

* I used Pandas to load and display the dataset.
* The app shows a preview of the data to help users understand it.

🧹 3. Add Data Cleaning Features
* I provided options to remove missing values, drop duplicates, and fill empty cells.
* Users can select which columns to clean using a simple interface.

⚙️ 4. Apply Filters & Transformations
* I added options to filter specific data based on conditions.
* Users can rename columns, change data types, or standardize values.

💾 5. Export Cleaned Data
* After cleaning, users can download the cleaned dataset as a CSV file.
* This makes it easy to use the cleaned data for further analysis.

Now, I have successfully built a Data Sweeper App using Streamlit! 🚀
